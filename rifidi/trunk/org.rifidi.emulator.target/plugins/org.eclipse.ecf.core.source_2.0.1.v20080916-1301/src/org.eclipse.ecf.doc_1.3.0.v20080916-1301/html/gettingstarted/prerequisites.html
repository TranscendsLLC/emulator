<p>
<h2>System Requirements</h2>
<p>ECF plugins will be built in Java and will be portable to any
platform supported by Eclipse. For components that might not run on
Eclipse (e.g. servers), all ECF-created code will be built to depend
only upon pure Java Standard Edition (1.4+). We also will look to
support OSGI Foundation as a minimum runtime platform.</p>
<p>You will need the following already installed on your machine:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Java version 1.4.2 or newer...1.5 or 1.6 OK also
    <pre>java version "1.4.2_04"<br>Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (build 1.4.2_04-b05)<br>Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 1.4.2_04-b05, mixed model</pre>
  </li>
  <li> <a
 href="http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/">Eclipse version 3.3 or newer</a><br>
    <br>
Earlier Eclipse Platform versions will work with some of the ECF APIs, but we have not tested them.  Also, 
we recently have taken advantage of the new UI features in 3.3 (tooltips improvements, menuContribution extension
point, etc), and that's why we now depend upon version 3.3.  For ECF APIs (plugins/bundles that do <b>not</b>
have *.ui in their bundle id), they generally support older runtime versions.  See the manifest.mf for each 
plugin if you want to know the execution environment requirements for each bundle.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
