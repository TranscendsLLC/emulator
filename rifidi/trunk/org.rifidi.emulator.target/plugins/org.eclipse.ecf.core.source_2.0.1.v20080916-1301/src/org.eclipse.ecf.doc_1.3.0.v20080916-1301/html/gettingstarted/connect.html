<h2>Connecting an ECF Collaboration Client to a Test Server</h2>
<ol>
  <li> Make sure ECF plugins are installed in one of three ways
described <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/ecf/downloads.html">here</a>.
  </li>
  <li> Open the Navigator View or the Package Explorer View. </li>
  <li> Select any Project (first create some new project if none
previously exists). </li>
  <li> Right-click on the project to bring up the context menu for the
selected project. </li>
  <li> Select the ECF menu toward the bottom of the menu and select one
of: </li>
  <ul>
    <li> 'Join Collaboration...' This will allow you to specify an URL
of the group to join. You must know of a currently running server (and
know it's URL) to use this option. </li>
    <li> 'Join Test Collaboration (Localhost)' This will connect you
directly to a test server running on localhost. See <a
 href="runserver.html">Running a Collaboration Server on Localhost</a>
if you wish to run this way. </li>
    <li> 'Join Test Collaboration (Composent)' This will connect you
directly to a test server running on composent.com. This is a test
server setup for the ECF team usage. You are welcome to try out
connecting to this server to test out/use the ECF example client. The
server's availability may not be consistent, however. </li>
  </ul>
</ol>
